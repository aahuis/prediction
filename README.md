# Prediction of exercise's quality

This analysis describes the analysis of the Exercise Dataset available at  http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har. The data set has already been split into a training, respectively testing data set. The analysis aims at creating a machine learning algorithm to predict how correct the athletes exercised (outcome 'classe' with value 'A').

The repository contains the Markdown script with the code, as well as a PDF compilation of the executed code and the report in which the analysis is described.
